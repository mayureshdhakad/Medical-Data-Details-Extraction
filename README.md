# Medical-Data-Details-Extraction
In this project, patient all data is extracted from the doctor prescription written for the patient. Prescription 
is in pdf format and the required extracted data is in JSON format.
Initially in the Jupyter notebook, the raw image in the pdf is transformed into good visible image format 
using OpenCV and then extracted that data in to text format using pytesseract and regular expressions.
In the PyCharm IDE, Python program is written for the same data extraction using pytesseract, regular 
expressions, pytest and Fast API. Postman is used for the API testing.
